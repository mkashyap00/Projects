# Healthcare Product Classification

This project is a real-world use case that addresses the challenge of automatically categorizing over-the-counter (OTC) healthcare products using multi-label classification to identify product segments, sub-segments, and target consumers from text descriptions. Using the ELECTRA transformer model with custom modifications for hierarchical label relationships, we achieved strong performance on unseen test data with accuracies of 89.33% for segment classification, 67.35% for sub-segment classification, and 92.27% for target consumer identification. Analysis of confidence distributions and prediction examples demonstrates the model's effectiveness in handling main category classification while revealing opportunities for improvement in sub-segment specificity. The system provides a scalable solution for automated product categorization in the healthcare domain, with potential applications in inventory management and e-commerce platforms.
